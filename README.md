This project is aimed at conducting exploratory data analysis on e-commerce data using Python. Our goal is to understand the dataset, discover interesting patterns, and extract valuable insights from the data. You can access the [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/carrie1/ecommerce-data) we will use for this application by clicking on it. 

This is a transnational data set which contains all the transactions occurring between 01/12/2010 and 09/12/2011 for a UK-based and registered non-store online retail.The company mainly sells unique all-occasion gifts. Many customers of the company are wholesalers.

Each column in this data can be used to ask numerous questions like the following and obtain their answers.

• How many different products are there in an order?

• What are the best-selling products?

• Which countries have a higher number of orders and total order value?

• On which date was the highest spending recorded?

• Which customers have made the highest purchases on date X?

• Who are the customers with the lowest purchase amounts?

• From which countries does customer X make purchases?

## Project Description
This project will be carried out using the Python programming language. Our main objectives are:

• Gain a general overview of the e-commerce dataset and its contents.

• Apply data cleaning and preprocessing steps, handle missing data, and address data inconsistencies.

• Visualize the data to identify interesting patterns, trends, and outliers.

• Perform basic statistical analyses to answer relevant questions.

• Understand customer profiles through segmentation and grouping analyses.



## Technologies Used
• **Python**: The core programming language for data analysis, manipulation, visualization, and statistical analysis.

• **Pandas**: A powerful library for data manipulation and analysis.

• **NumPy**: A fundamental package for numerical computations in Python.

• **Matplotlib and Seaborn**: Libraries for data visualization.

• **PyCharm**: An integrated development environment for Python.

• **Jupyter Notebook**: Used for interactive coding and documenting analysis results.


## Analysis Steps
**1- Data Loading and Overview**:

• Load the e-commerce dataset using Pandas.

• Display basic information about the dataset like column names, data types, and first few rows.

**2- Data Cleaning and Preprocessing**:

• Handle missing data by imputation or removal.

• Address data inconsistencies and anomalies.

• Convert data types if needed.

**3- Data Visualization**:

• Create histograms, box plots, and scatter plots to visualize distributions and relationships.

• Use bar plots and pie charts to show categorical data proportions.

• Identify outliers and potential anomalies through visual exploration.
