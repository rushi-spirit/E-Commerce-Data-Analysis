# E-Commerce-Data-Analysis


This project performs exploratory data analysis (EDA) on e-commerce sales data using Python. The dataset consists of transactional data from a UK-based online retail company specializing in unique all-occasion gifts, with many customers being wholesalers.  

The dataset allows us to explore and answer questions such as:  
- How many products are typically included in an order?  
- Which are the best-selling products?  
- Which countries generate the highest number of orders and total order value?  
- What was the highest recorded spending?  
- Who are the top and lowest spending customers?  
- Where do specific customers make their purchases?  


## Project Objectives  

- Understand the structure and content of the e-commerce dataset.  
- Apply data cleaning and preprocessing to ensure data quality.  
- Use data visualization to identify trends, patterns, and outliers.  
- Perform statistical analysis to extract actionable insights.  
- Segment and analyze customer profiles to uncover behavioral patterns.  


## Technologies Used  

- **Python**: is the primary language for analysis.  
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and cleaning.  
- **NumPy**: For numerical computations.  
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn**: For creating visualizations.  
- **Jupyter Notebook**: For interactive analysis and documentation.  
- **PyCharm**: For efficient development and debugging.  

## Analysis Workflow  

### **1. Data Loading and Exploration**  
- Load the dataset using Pandas.  
- Display column names, data types, and basic statistics.  
- Inspect the data for an initial understanding.  

### **2. Data Cleaning and Preprocessing**  
- Handle missing data by imputation or removal.  
- Address inconsistencies and anomalies in the dataset.  
- Convert data types and formats where necessary.  

### **3. Data Visualization**  
- Use histograms and box plots to analyze distributions.  
- Create bar charts and pie charts for categorical insights.  
- Identify outliers and trends using scatter plots and heatmaps.
